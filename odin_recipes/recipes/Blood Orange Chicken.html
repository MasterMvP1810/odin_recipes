    <p>
        Chicken with blood oranges? I am so in love with this recipe! I set out to create a dish that highlighted the
        deep citrus flavor and absolutely beautiful coloring of blood oranges. Pair it with some fresh steamed
        vegetables for a healthy dinner!

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>5 blood oranges, divided</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>½ onion, minced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>¾ cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
    </ul>

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place chicken breasts into a glass or ceramic bowl. Juice two of the blood oranges over the chicken. Cover
            the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Discard remaining
            marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook for about 4 minutes per side.
            Transfer to a plate and cover with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Juice the remaining three blood oranges.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a clean skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is
            translucent and garlic begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining blood orange juice, chicken
            stock, white wine, and parsley; bring to a boil. Return chicken to the skillet, reduce the heat to low, and
            cover. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink inside, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer
            inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to serving
            plates.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add honey to the pan juices and simmer until dissolved and the sauce has thickened, about 2 minutes. Spoon
            sauce over chicken and serve.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finish it
        </li>
    </ol>
