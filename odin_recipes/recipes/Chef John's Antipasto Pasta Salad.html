    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        An antipasto is a cold platter of meat, cheese, and vegetables which is served at the start of a meal before the
        pasta and other courses, but to save some time, I thought I'd add the pasta right into the antipasto to turn it
        into a complete meal all by itself. You could serve this antipasto pasta salad recipe as a side dish, but with a
        hunk of crusty bread and a glass of wine, I'm not sure what else you'd need. Top with more parsley before
        serving.

    <h2>
        Directions
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain thoroughly in a colander, but do
            not rinse; stir to release heat. Cool in the colander for 5 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, mash anchovy fillet and garlic into a paste in a large bowl with a whisk or fork. Whisk in
            vinegar, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, oregano, thyme, salt, and black pepper to combine. Slowly drizzle in
            olive oil, whisking constantly, until smooth, thick, and vinaigrette coats the back of a spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss pasta into bowl with vinaigrette until well coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss in artichoke hearts, red peppers, black olives, green olives, red onion, jalapeño, and pepperoncini.
            Stir in salami, pepperoni, provolone cheese, and ham; mix thoroughly to combine. Cover bowl with plastic
            wrap; refrigerate until well chilled, 3 to 12 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in tomatoes and parsley; mix thoroughly. Taste; adjust seasoning if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finish it
        </li>
    </ol>
