        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This chicken and asparagus casserole with noodles is great to make in the spring when asparagus first comes in
            and you can get it fresh. Add salsa to the sour cream mixture if you like a spicier dish.

        <h2>Steps
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 1 1/2-quart
                casserole dish.
                
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until
                almost tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well.
                
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring
                frequently. Add cooked chicken, red bell pepper, celery, and chicken stock. Bring to a boil and simmer
                for 5 minutes. Stir in sour cream and oregano.
                
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread 1/2 of the chicken mixture into the prepared dish; arrange asparagus on top. Spread cooked noodles
                evenly over asparagus and top with 5 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. Cover with remaining chicken
                mixture and sprinkle remaining 3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese on top. Bake in the preheated oven until
                cheese has melted and top is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
